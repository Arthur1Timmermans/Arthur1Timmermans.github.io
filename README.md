# Arthur1Timmermans.github.io

within this github ripository my personal website is hosted. On the website I created a portfolio to showcase my skills and view points. 

This repository only contains the html files, images, figures. 
These files were rendered using R-markdown and bookdown. 

All rmd files, data, and instructions on how to use these rmd files and data can be found in my other repository: https://github.com/Arthur1Timmermans/portofolio
